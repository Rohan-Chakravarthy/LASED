See [Farrell's paper ](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.37.4240) for the atomic level diagram and information about the hyperfine structure modelling. Farrell also compares the QED approach to the semi-classical (SC) model and shows that the SC model agrees with the QED model at low intensities but the approaches diverge at higher intensities.\n",
